# MFA Python Bypass

This repository contains a Python script designed to interact with the Discord API, specifically for automating MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) processes and managing vanity URLs in Discord servers.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Automates MFA Handling**: Efficiently generates MFA tickets and tokens using the Discord API.
- **Vanity URL Management**: Updates Discord server vanity URLs with ease.
- **Secure and Configurable**: Reads sensitive data like tokens and passwords from a `config.json` file to ensure user-specific configurations.

## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Python 3.7+**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Dependencies**: Install the required Python package:
   ```bash
   pip install tls-client typing-extensions
   ```
3. **Discord API Token**: Obtain your Discord bot or user token.
4. **Vanity Code**: The custom code you want to set for your Discord server's vanity URL.

## Setup üöÄ
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kneeling/Discord-MFA-Vanity-Bypass.git
   cd Discord-MFA-Vanity-Bypass
   ```
2. Create a `config.json` file with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
       "vanity-code": "your-vanity-code",
       "password": "your-mfa-password",
       "token": "your-discord-token"
   }
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How It Works üß†
1. **Initialization**: 
   - The script initializes a session using `tls-client` to emulate a Chrome browser.
   - Reads configurations from `config.json`.

2. **MFA Ticket Generation**:
   - Uses the Discord API to request an MFA ticket tied to the provided vanity code.

3. **Vanity Token Retrieval**:
   - Completes the MFA process using the password and MFA ticket to retrieve an authentication token.

## Security Notes üîí
- **Token Safety**: Your Discord token grants access to your account or bot. Never share it publicly.
- **Use Responsibly**: This script interacts with the Discord API. Ensure you're adhering to Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Developer Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy).
